GEANT4 package: the Xurich-II TPC in the neutron laboratory

This code has been developed for a complete model of the Xurich-II TPC in the neutron laboratory at the University of Zurich. The simulations served as a basis for optimization of the detector design and the experimetal setup.

The detector and its performance are described in:
